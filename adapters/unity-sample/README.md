# Unity Sample Project (Skeleton)

This is a minimal Unity project structure showing how to use the native `core_c` library via P/Invoke.

Instructions:
1. Create a new empty Unity project.
2. Copy the contents of `adapters/unity-sample/Assets` into your Unity project's `Assets`.
3. Build `core_c` (see repo README) and place the resulting shared library under `Assets/Plugins/<Platform>/`.
4. Open Unity, run the scene `Assets/Scenes/Sample.unity`.
