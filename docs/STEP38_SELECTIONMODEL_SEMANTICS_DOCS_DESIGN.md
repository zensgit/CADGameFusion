# Step 38: SelectionModel Semantics Docs - Design

## Goal
- Document SelectionModel as the single source of truth for UI selection.
- Align docs and code annotations with the SelectionModel -> Canvas view-only flow.

## Changes
1. Document selection flow in the Qt UI shell design.
2. Clarify Canvas as a view cache in the Step 9 SelectionModel design.
3. Add a class-level annotation in `SelectionModel`.
