Issue — Daily CI: add 7‑day trend and artifact lookup guardrails

Scope
- Render a 7‑day trend row (success/failure, p50/p95) using existing summaries.
- Keep artifact fallback names in sync with workflow files across Ubuntu/macOS/Windows.

Tasks
- Use `scripts/ci_trend_summary.sh` to emit the 7‑day section into `CI_DAILY_STATUS.md`.
- Ensure artifact listing/debug output remains and periodically verify names match workflow files.

Acceptance
- Daily CI generates successfully each day with a 7‑day row; missing artifacts are clearly listed in the comment.

References
- `.github/workflows/daily-ci-status.yml`
