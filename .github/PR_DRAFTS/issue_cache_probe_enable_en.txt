Issue — Enable cache_probe only when compiled deps are introduced

Context
- Current deps are header‑only; vcpkg hit rate shows N/A (expected).
- cache_probe already implemented in workflows; default off.

When to enable
- When a new compiled (non header‑only) port is added, run workflows with `cache_probe=true` once; rerun to observe >0% hits.

Acceptance
- Strict exports/build tests run twice; Daily CI shows non‑zero hit or N/A for header‑only.
